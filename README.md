# ugahacks-7 - NCR's Retail Gamification Challenge
For ugahacks-7, I've decided to focus on NCR's Gamification challenge since I really want an oculus rift to join the metaverse.
The description for the challenge is as follows:
> Social media applications and mobile games have mastered the art of keeping users engaged with their applications. 
> Apply their “addictive” tactics (daily spins, flashy interfaces, etc.) to make an application for retailers to help them keep their customers coming back.

There was an interest in a Tinder-like food recommendation app, but that already exists, so I'm aiming for something that is more focused on flashy animations/recommendations/a adaptable algorithm.
