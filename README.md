# ugahacks-7 - NCR's Retail Gamification Challenge

For ugahacks-7, I've decided to focus on NCR's Gamification challenge since I really want an oculus rift to join the metaverse.
The description for the challenge is as follows:

> Social media applications and mobile games have mastered the art of keeping users engaged with their applications.
> Apply their “addictive” tactics (daily spins, flashy interfaces, etc.) to make an application for retailers to help them keep their customers coming back.

There was an interest in a Tinder-like food recommendation app, but that already exists, so I'm aiming for something that is more focused on flashy animations/recommendations/a adaptable algorithm.

## idea - A modern and sleeker take on PokemonGo/Map-based/Profile-based games with a focus on food

TODO: flesh out idea features

## planning features

- fancy loadup/fancy animations
  - svg, fontawesome, icons8, animations, references online
  - consistent theming and colors
- profile feature
  - authentication/sso
  - save profile data
- reward system
  - points from restaurants/orders (incentivize for social causes)
  - level system
- social system

  - media feed for friends/people who've earned points recently in your area
  - new restaurant openings/tbd openings

- sub-task
